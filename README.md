# webMap

Definitely a tool in a beta. The concept is to map out a domain with a network visualization graph. I was looking for a 
consistent way of taking notes while testing web applications, and also trying to find a idea for a programming project
that wouldn't be cliche or a copy of anything. Eventually I could add some features, but this was mainly just a project 
to prove to myself that I could write something if I put my mind to it. It's a got some bugs that would take 
some searching and rewriting to get through, but the core concept is functional. I seriously enjoyed the challenge this was,
and think I'll start, at the very least, scripting more.  

I was shown another way of taking notes very close to when I got this project functional, and was given a reminder... I had forgotten the core concept of computer programming. "BE LAZY", of course this is talking about not writing repetitive code, but, in this case, making a simple document in vim and start testing so you make note of odd behaviors, filters to hopefully bypass, or eventually, vulnerabilities.
